Compiling instructions
Each Euler solution can be complied and run individually or as a set. 
Each solution compiles to its own executable named <problem number>.out

To compile an individual solution: 
	Make <solution number>
		ex: Make 1
To compile a set containing the first three solutions:
	Make 1 2 3
To compile the entire collection:
	Make

The MakeFile does have a clean function that removes .o, temp and executable files (.out).

To run file:
	Each c file named <number>Euler.cc creates a .o (object) file and an executable files named <number>.out.
	To run the file, click the icon or in the command line:
		./<number>.out
		ex: ./01.out
If a solution requires user input, it will request it upon starting.
